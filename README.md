## Running the code

### Running against the examples

These are the small examples given in the text of the problem

Everything:

```
cargo test
```

Specific year:

```
cargo test year2024
```

Specific day:

```
cargo test year2024::day04
```

### Running against puzzle inputs

First, place the relevant puzzle inputs in the path `input/yearXXXX/dayYY.txt`

To run everything:

```
cargo run
```

Specific year:

```
cargo run year2024
```

Specific day:

```
cargo run year2024 day04
```

The output should look something like this:

```
year2024 day04
    Part 1: 2517
    Part 2: 1960
